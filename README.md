The task
----------
[Build a Camper Leaderboard](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-camper-leaderboard)

### Objective
Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to [this](https://codepen.io/FreeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/)

### Rules
* Use whichever libraries or APIs you need
* You must use both SASS and React to build this project

### User stories
* I can see a table of the Free Code Camp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days
* I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total
* I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and
by how many brownie points they've earned total

### Hints
* Top 100 campers for the last [30 days](https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent)
* Top 100 campers of [all time](https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime)


Built with
----------
* [React.js](https://facebook.github.io/react) &#8212; a JavaScript library for building user interfaces

  language in the world
* [timeago.js](http://timeago.org) &#8212; a tiny (2kb) library used to format date with `*** time ago`,
